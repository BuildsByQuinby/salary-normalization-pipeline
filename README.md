# Salary Normalization & Feature Engineering Pipeline

This project demonstrates end-to-end preprocessing and normalization of real-world salary survey data.

## What This Project Does
- Identifies and removes duplicate records  
- Handles missing values using forward-fill and statistical techniques  
- Applies Min-Max scaling and Z-score standardization to compensation data  
- Analyzes skewed distributions and extreme outliers  
- Visualizes normalization effects and distribution changes  

## Why It Matters
Compensation data is highly skewed and sensitive to outliers.  
Proper normalization ensures fair analysis, accurate modeling, and meaningful visualizations.

This pipeline prepares real survey data for downstream analytics, reporting, and machine learning workflows.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

Built as part of hands-on data wrangling and normalization exercises.
